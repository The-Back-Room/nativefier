# TO DO
A list of planned features and updates for nativefier. This list is not at all a final list of updates. It is just a small list of features we would like to add if at all possible.

- **Mobile App Packaging**: Add support for Android and iOS mobile app packaging.
- **Electron Configuration**: Improve electron implementation to be less manual for ease of management. *(As it stands it currently is coded to use a specific version of electron and that requires manual updating which is not very efficient. Optimizing this would be more efficient and **hopefully** easier to maintain.)*
- **Discord RPC Support**: Add optional flag for discord rich presence support.
- **Dedicated Website and/or App**: Package the service into it's own dedicated website and/or app to allow simpler use without needing to run it directly in command line.
- **App Icons Repo**: Reimplement the official icons repo for apps and ensure nativefier pulls from our implementation. *(I would like to add a scraper to the that repo as well to scrape the official sources for new icons occasionally in order to keep all icons properly up to date.)*
